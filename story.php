                            <p>It was year 2012 when I enrolled in Diploma CSE, I loved the world of computers & was
                                obsessed with it. </p>
                            <p>But one year into the program my GPA was suffering and I hated coding & math.</p>
                            <p>Fastforward to the year 2013 & 2014 I failed in math and had to sit out of college for 2
                                whole years.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This was the lowest point in my life</li>
                                <li>I started questioning all my decisions</li>
                                <li>I was super worried about my future</li>
                                <li>Who will employ a guy like me?</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h6>It took a While But..</h6>
                        <h3>I was finally able to find my calling</h3>
                        <p>By the end of the year 2020 I had finally completed my B.Tech in Computer engineering.</p>
                        <p>I recall that at the time, a buddy of mine introduced me to the subject of user experience and
                            interface design and said, "In this field, you can get paid to create things."</p>
                        <p>I was hooked. I started exploring what is UI UX and started grinding ruthlessly. I also joined a
                            UI UX Program</p>
                        <p>I finally was able to secure a job in one of the finest company out there, and from there on my
                            career started to take off.</p>

                        <h3>What all this had to with PAUx</h3>
                        <p>Given the current market scenario there are thousands of Students who want to pursue a career in
                            UI UX designing</p>
                        <p>Also, there are dozens of design schools which are offering good courses, but some of them are
                            focusing more on the marketing aspect and less on the actual teaching aspect</p>
                        <p>So these students end up joining them by looking their ads constantly in their feed.</p>
                        <p>Their ads consist of the same old marketing cliché to attract all the new & innocent students</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learn UI UX Designing just for 500 Rps</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>For enrolling to their courses the students have pay a entry fees to attend to lecture and if
                            they wish to
                            join it then the fees is extremely high.</p>
                        <p>How do I know all this, well I have met numerous students who have joined their courses and the
                            feedback among these student was the same “the course was very basic and price was way too
                            high for the value of knowledge we got. Nothing like FAANG was thought”</p>
                        <p>Even after completing the course they were struggling to land a job</p>
