                        <p>To ensure that you get the most out of your time at the programme, PAUX is a hybrid
                            learning environment that blends industry experience with a capstone project. </p>
                        <p>Additionally, PAUx offers a paid internship programme where you can get knowledge of
                            numerous facets of the design profession.</p>

                        <p>Even other schools lack some of the features and services that we offer.</p>
                        <p>Instead than using the same generic method that other design schools use, we fully believe in communicating with the students and giving them the knowledge they need to succeed in the design field.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, you have long-term access to the specially curated design resources database.</p>

                        <p>Yes, a completion certificate will be sent to you. While we are aware of the importance of certificates for overall development, we also firmly think that the main goal should be to develop a solid portfolio, advance your career, and land a job with a reputable company.</p>

                        <ol>

                    </div>
                    <div class="answer-box">
                        <p>Yes, of course, PAUx offers internship opportunities that too paid because we personally hate the firms which are offering unpaid internships, but here in PAUx we offer a paid internship(with a good stipend).</p>
                        <p>However, to acquire this internship you will have to pass a assessment that will be given to you, just to know whether or not you’re ready for it.</p>
